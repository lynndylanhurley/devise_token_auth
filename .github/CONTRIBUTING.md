# Contribution Guidelines

## Suggest changes

1. Create a feature branch with your changes.
2. Write some test cases.
3. Make all the tests pass.
4. Issue a Pull Request.

I will grant you commit access if you send quality pull requests.

## Run the tests

**Prepare** by installing and migrating the database:

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `bundle install`
1. Run `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
1. Run `RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate`

Now your environment is ready to run tests.

To run the full **test suite** with the [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) test runner:

```shell
bundle exec guard
```

Guard will re-run each test suite when changes are made to its corresponding files.

To run **just one test**: Flavio Castelli blogged about [how to execute a single unit test (or even a single test method)](https://flavio.castelli.me/2010/05/28/rails_execute_single_test/) instead of running the complete unit test suite.
