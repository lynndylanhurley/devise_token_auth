When posting issues, please include the following information to speed up the troubleshooting process:

* **Version**: which version of this gem (and [ng-token-auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/ng-token-auth), [jToker](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/j-toker) or [Angular2-Token](https://github.com/neroniaky/angular2-token) if applicable) are you using?
* **Request and response headers**: these can be found in the "Network" tab of your browser's web inspector.
* **Rails Stacktrace**: this can be found in the `log/development.log` of your API.
* **Environmental Info**: How is your application different from the [reference implementation](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth_demo)? This may include (but is not limited to) the following details:
  * **Routes**: are you using some crazy namespace, scope, or constraint?
  * **Gems**: are you using MongoDB, Grape, RailsApi, ActiveAdmin, etc.?
  * **Custom Overrides**: what have you done in terms of [custom controller overrides](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth/#custom-controller-overrides)?
  * **Custom Frontend**: are you using [ng-token-auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/ng-token-auth), [jToker](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/j-toker), [Angular2-Token](https://github.com/neroniaky/angular2-token), or something else?
